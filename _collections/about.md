## Why Meta Hunch?

This site consists of collections of posts, comments, open questions with respect to artificial intelligence or more specifically machine learning. Hunches are kind of emotion arisen through the latent reorganization of the reprojection of old knowledge. We hope through obtaining hunches in meta-level, we can reach certain points that motivate others. Moreover, self-fulfillment and personality satisfaction are driven us to write down our meta hunches pragmatically.

> Motivated by Sanjeev Arora's [offconvex](https://www.offconvex.org/) and John Langford's [hunch.net](http://hunch.net/). We are hallucinating a personality-fulfilled site named [Meta Hunch](https://metahunch.github.io). With our initial instinct, we would like the site as a 'Tahiti' for us to hold logically sound, and most possibly mathematically oriented hunches. Those hunches might shine not for the well-formulatedness or strict-proofs but for the essential importance to the community and independent organization of scattering knowledge. We will write with our respects towards many great minds in the statistics, machine learning, computational linguistics and et cetera.
